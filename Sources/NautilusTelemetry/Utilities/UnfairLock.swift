/// A Swift wrapper for `os_unfair_lock`
/// This is faster than using a serial GCD queue or other higher-level constructs.
/// Caution is advised though. Unfair lock:
/// - Is unfair, and may cause waiter starvation
/// - Does not support recursive locking (but neither does dispatch sync)
/// - Does not allow you to lock and unlock from different threads
/// - Is only recommended for protecting small critical sections
